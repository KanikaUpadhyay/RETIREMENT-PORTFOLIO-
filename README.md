# RETIREMENT-PORTFOLIO-
This project designs a 25-year retirement plan tailored for a mid-career professional working in international markets. The portfolio is constructed using a core-satellite strategy, balancing fixed income (50%), commodities (20%), equities (20%), and cash (10%) to achieve both stability and inflation protection.

-Risk Analysis: Calculated expected return (6.45%), volatility (4.92%), Sharpe Ratio (0.60), and 95% Value at Risk (VaR).
-Withdrawal Strategy: Applied the 4% rule for sustainable retirement income (~₹22 Lakhs annually).
-Rebalancing & Risk Controls: Implemented quarterly rebalancing, drawdown rules, and liquidity buffers.

# Deliverables
