# RETIREMENT-PORTFOLIO-
This project designs a 25-year retirement plan tailored for a mid-career professional working in international markets. The portfolio is constructed using a core-satellite strategy, balancing fixed income (50%), commodities (20%), equities (20%), and cash (10%) to achieve both stability and inflation protection.
